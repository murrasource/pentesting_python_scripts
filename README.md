# pentesting_python_scripts
A collection of Python scripts for pentesting. Rather than being a script kiddie, I have decided to learn how things work under the hood so I have a better foundational understanding.

## changeMAC.py
Allows a Linux user to change their MAC Address to whatever they choose.

## networkSCAN.py
A homemade version of the `arp -a` command in Powershell and Bash.

## packetSNIFF.py
Useful for a MITM attack. This intercepts packets and searches them for URLs and Login Information for those websites.

## spoofARP.py
This is the script used to conduct a MITM attack. It maintains the modified ARP table on the network while the script is running. When it quits, it restores everything back to its original state (so you don't need to worry about messing things up too badly).
